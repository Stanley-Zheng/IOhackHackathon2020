The following are required dependencies: 


python 3 or newer
node.js
populartimes


in order to run populartimes, you must cd into the populartimes-master file and run pip install pathtofile/populartimes-master

Other required dependencies are socket.io and express, but they are already packaged with the github repo so you do not need to install them.
